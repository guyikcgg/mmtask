# mmtask
multi-(macro)-task is a library for cooperative multitasking using macros.

mmtask is written in pure C language, and it only uses a few simple macros. It should be possible to compile a program using `mmtask` for every platform or micro-controller.

It is based on the code from [this thread](http://cboard.cprogramming.com/cplusplus-programming/140384-counting-macro.html), and it is evolving into something similar to the simplest implementation of ASG (Asynchronous State Graphs), by [Marc Lobelle, from UCLouvain](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marc-Lobelle).
